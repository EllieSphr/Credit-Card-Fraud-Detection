# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. The dataset is highly imbalanced, so techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) were used to handle class imbalance. Two machine learning models, Logistic Regression and Random Forest, were trained and evaluated for performance.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project comes from Kaggle: Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset.
	•	Number of Samples: 284,807 transactions
	•	Fraudulent Transactions: 492 (0.17%)
	•	Non-Fraudulent Transactions: 284,315 (99.83%)
	•	Features: 30 (28 anonymized features, Amount, and Class)
